**BILL TO:** Graduate Student Leaders

**FROM:** James Hammer, President

**RE:** Amend Code of Laws to clarify teaching award title

**DATE:** July 9, 2013

**ID:** 20130709-08

I ask for approval of the following:

To amend the GSL Code of Laws from:

> *(In Article 5:)*

> Further amendments to this Code of Laws must be proposed either by a Leader or a petition
of at least one-third of the DMS graduate students, and passed by a two-thirds vote of the
Leaders.

To read:

> *(In Article 5:)*

> Further amendments to this Code of Laws may be proposed by any group of five or more
DMS Graduate Students, and should be brought to a committee Leader at any point during
the semester. The Leader will then bring it to the President and Vice President of the GSL.
The proposed amendment will then be emailed to the entire DMS graduate student
population. In two weeks, a vote will be presented to the DMS graduate student population.
A simple majority will decide whether the amendment carries or not.
