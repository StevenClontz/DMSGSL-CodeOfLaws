I ask for approval of the following:

remaining GSL members.

To read:

> *(In Section 2.1 of Article 2:)*

> Mid-term vacancies of any Leader within the first six months of the appointment shall be filled
by majority vote of the DMS graduate student population. Nominations will be called for as
soon as the vacancy arises, and elections will occur two weeks after the nominations are
called for. After the six month mark, the current chair of the DMS will appoint a new leader. If
there are no volunteers for the position, the current chair of the department will elect a Leader
from the DMS graduate student population.
