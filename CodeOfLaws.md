## Preamble

The Graduate Student Leaders of the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/) (DMS-GSL or GSL) at Auburn University are a group of students tapped by the DMS Department Chair to represent the DMS graduate student community.

The President and Vice President of the GSL should also be tapped by the DMS Graduate Program Officer as [Graduate Student Council](http://www.auburn.edu/gsc/) Senators representing DMS.

All six members are known as Leaders. As the goal of this organization is to represent both domestic and international graduate students, the Department Chair should appoint Leaders such that there are at least two domestic and two international Leaders each year.
